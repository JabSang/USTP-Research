	-> Purely citations (Defines linear search algorithm)

2. A New Modified Linear Search Algorithm - 1

	-> 1st Perfect reference (creates a N midpoint, wherein searching starts at beginning of divided arrays)

3. Two way Linear Search Algorithm - 1

	-> 1st Perfect reference (creates a 1 midpoint, wherein searching starts at beginning and end of the array)

4. Multipart Sequential Search Algorithm - 1

	-> 2nd Perfect reference (creates a N midpoint, wherein searching starts at beginning of divided arrays)

5. To-Fro Sequential Search Algorithm â€“ An Alternative to Linear Search

	-> 1st Perfect reference (creates a 1 midpoint, wherein searching starts at left and right of the array's midpoint)
